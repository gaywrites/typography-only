    <blockquote>
        Pokémon is a multimedia franchise that began as a video game series in 1996, created by Satoshi Tajiri and Ken Sugimori. <br>At its core, Pokémon (short for "Pocket Monsters") revolves around fictional creatures that humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport. <br>Players take on the role of Pokémon Trainers with the goal of catching and training Pokémon to become stronger and compete in battles. <br>There are various species of Pokémon, each with unique abilities, types, and attributes, and they can evolve into more powerful forms and learn new moves as they gain experience. <br>Battles are turn-based, where Trainers use their Pokémon's moves strategically to defeat opponents, earning badges, experience points, and other rewards. <br>In the games, Trainers often travel through regions to defeat Gym Leaders and collect badges, with the ultimate goal of becoming the Champion of the Pokémon League.
